VSCode extension to return the current [Pick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick_operating_system) (and Pick related flavours) internal date & time to the clipboard.

Default key binding is Ctrl-Alt-P

![Using Pickdate!](https://github.com/stuboydl/pickdate/blob/main/pickdate.gif?raw=true)

- Output to clipboard is space delimited pick *internal* `date` `time` value.
- Pick internal date is defined as days from 1967-12-31.
- Pick internal time is defined as seconds from 00:00 of the current day.

These values are usually based on your local PC timezone. eg 2022-08-12T22:54:04+10 (Australia/Sydney).
>At this time the extension doesn't cater for setting a different timezone. eg, to match your *Pick* DB server.
